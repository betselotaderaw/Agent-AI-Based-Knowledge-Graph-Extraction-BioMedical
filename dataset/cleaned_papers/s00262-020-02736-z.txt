Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of both estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR)
receptors as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and is associated with poor prognosis. Moreover,
the systemic treatment options are limited. However, the TNBC is more likely than other breast cancer subtypes to benefit
from immune checkpoint blockade therapy due to its higher immunogenicity, higher enrichment by tumour-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs), and higher levels of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Thus far, atezolizumab was
approved in combination with nab-paclitaxel for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC whose
tumours express PD-L1. Currently, it seems that PD-L1-positive subgroup will potentially benefit the most from the immune
checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. Moreover, it seems that better results are seen when an ICI is given as first-line treatment
than when an ICI is given in later lines of treatment for advanced TNBC/metastatic TNBC. Recently, pembrolizumab has
demonstrated promising results in early-stage TNBC what can lead in near future to its approval in (neo)adjuvant setting.
This review summarizes the development and highlights recent advances of the atezolizumab and pembrolizumab in early
and advanced/metastatic TNBC.

LDH at baseline was related with rapid disease progression
. The median PFS and median OS were 1.9 months and
11.2 months, respectively . Most likely, the higher the
PD-L1 expression, the better the results that can be obtained
. In total, at least 56% of patients had at least one TRAE
and the most common of any grade included arthralgia,
fatigue, myalgia, followed by nausea . The incidences
of colitis, hepatitis and hypothyroidism were classified as
immune-mediated AEs . Most importantly this study
has shown that immunotherapy can be relatively safe and
effective in some heavily pretreated patients .
The natural continuation of a previous study was the
phase II KEYNOTE-086 trial . In cohort B, pembroli-
zumab was administered every 3 weeks for up to 2 years as
first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1-positive mTNBC
. Patients with brain metastases were excluded. More
than 60% of women had TRAE with the most common of
fatigue, nausea and diarrhea . Pembrolizumab mono-
therapy showed durable antitumour activity with an ORR
of 21.4%, including 4 CR . Usually, patients need to
wait 2 months until a response is achieved, but the median
duration of response was 10.4 months . The median PFS
and median OS were 2.1 months and 18.0 months, respec-
tively . In cohort A, pembrolizumab was administered
in the same manner as in cohort B, but cohort A comprised
previously treated patients because of mTNBC with PD-
L1-positive or PD-L1-negative tumours . More than 68%
of patients received at least two prior lines of therapy for
metastatic disease . In cohort A, the ORR was modest
(5.3%) and only slightly better in the PD-L1-positive popula-
tion . In total, two CR were noted and all in PD-L1-pos-
itive population . The median PFS and median OS were
2.0 months and 9.0 months, respectively . There were
no significant differences in survival regarding PD-L1 status
. TRAE was noted in 60% of patients. In the cohort A
and B, thyroid disorders were the most common immune-
mediated AEs [23, 24]. Taken together, findings from both
cohorts suggest that there is a higher possibility of achieving
a response to pembrolizumab in untreated or in patients who
received an anti-PD-1 drug in the early lines of treatment
because of mTNBC, especially in those with PD-L1-pos-
itive tumours. Although this was a phase II study with a
small group of patients and a subgroup of responders, the
responses were durable, and the toxicity profile was accept-
able [23, 24].
Unfortunately, in the randomized phase III KEY-
NOTE-119 (NCT02555657) study, pembrolizumab mono-
therapy did not show an improvement in ORR, PFS, or OS
as compared to single-agent chemotherapy in participants
with previously treated mTNBC (Table 1) . However, it
seems that patients with the highest levels of tumour PD-L1
expression had the greatest benefit regarding an ORR and
median OS with ICI . Recently, a potential positive
